# You ready to get bitShifted?

Sometimes you want to say a thing, but also you want to say that thing with characters shifted bitwise to the left or the right.

This is the tool for doing that thing.

It's just a scrappy frontend for [an old joke](https://gist.github.com/cachilders/52302745f203910d4b70620cf019cfe6).

It's a little wet at the moment, and it would welcome a PR or two.
